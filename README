Sample code for creating sacred geometric shadograms based on FirstHand model at http://meru.org

This project contains:
 ./vrml -  an ancient perl script which writes a vrlm file to stdout - if you have a vrml player, you might even be able to run this as a cgi, or generate a static vrml file and load this.
 ./applet -an a java applet, which relies on the java3d library.

It is quite doubtful that this software runs as is, but the core algorithm for creating a FirstHand sprial by projecting the theta=1/r spiral onto a tourus should port pretty easily to any 3d framwork (next stop: html5 canvas element).

Sample code for creating sacred geometric shadograms based on FirstHand model at http://meru.org

The software models the FirstHand sprial in 3D by projecting the theta=1/r spiral onto a tourus, and the algortithm should port pretty easily to any 3d framwork.

This project contains:
 == vrml model ==
 ./vrml -  a perl script which writes a vrlm file to stdout - The program can  run this as a cgi, but until it accepts runtime paramters, you might as well  generate a static vrml file and load this in a vrml browser plugin (or directly in a vrml player (e.g. http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/)
 == java applet ==
 ./applet -an a java applet, which relies on the java3d library. It is quite doubtful that this software runs as is.

TODO: 
* Create cylindrical thumb models, to occlude spiral and view the letter forms
* expose spiral/tourus parameters
* bookmark perspectives
* implement FirstHand as an html5 canvas element).
